Customizing Twitter Bootstrap 3.0.0

The next upcoming release of [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap "Twitter Bootstrap") will be a strong rewrite of the framework, with the *mobile first* approach.

They added `sm` (small), `md` (medium) and `lg` (large) CSS classes.

In this customization, there is also a fourth CSS class `wd` (wide), to identify devices wider than 1200px.



    /* Small to Wide */

    /* Small only */
    @media (max-width: 767px) {

    }

    /* Medium to Large */
    @media (min-width: 768px) {

    }

    /* Large to Wide */
    @media (min-width: 992px) {

    }

    /* Wide and larger */
    @media (min-width: 1200px) {

    }
